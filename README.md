# React-Todo-App
 React-Todo-App

# About the project
In this simple to-do application, the expression we get from the input is added to the todo list. The TodoList component lists the array it gets with the "todos" prop. Each list element represents the component.

# Things to do
- Create a component called TodoHeader. 
- Render Todo List header in h1 tag.
- Click on a to-do element in the list to make it visible with a strikethrough.
- Add delete functionality with a "Delete" button that will appear next to each element in the list.
# Tips
You can add the delete functionality with a function to be given to the onClick event by adding the "Delete" button next to the content in the TodoItem component.
For delete functionality, you can filter on "todos" in state with filter function and update state that way.
